# Mental Health Support

This project is designed to assist individuals suffering from mental illness, specifically dementia. The platform helps patients remember their family members and themselves, offering essential support in managing memory loss.

## Project Overview
This initiative falls under the **Social Good** theme of the Scroll Hacks hackathon. Our solution leverages technology to improve the quality of life for those affected by dementia, providing personalized reminders and memory aids to help users maintain connections with loved ones and regain a sense of self.

By integrating user-friendly tools, we aim to contribute positively to the mental health space and offer a compassionate solution to those in need.
